            <p class="tdnp">Manchester City midfielder Nico Gonzalez was forced off due to injury while making his debut in the FA Cup against Leyton Orient on Saturday.

                Nico arrived from Porto for Â£50m on Deadline Day and was thrust into the starting line-up by Pep Guardiola, before losing possession in the build-up to the shock opener as Jamie Donley's long-range effort cannoned off Stefan Ortega and into the back of the net.
                
                Nico appeared to go down clutching his lower back and was replaced by Bernardo Silva after a short talk with the medical team.
                
                
                "I think Nico got immediately what is the Premier League and the referees," Guardiola said after the game. 
                
                "I know without VAR it is more difficult because they are not used to it but there were one or two actions. I say that because we won, otherwise I would stay silent, but there was a clear penalty.
                
                "I think he understood perfectly what England is. It's a pity because I don't know how hard the kick is but he could not continue.
                
                "I don't know how hard the shot was but he couldn't continue."</p>

            <h3 class="tdnh">FIFA Suspends Pakistan Football Federation</h3>
            <p class="tdnp">The International Football Federation (FIFA) has suspended the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) after it failed to make amendments to its constitution which the world body deemed necessary for smooth and just governance of the sport in the country. The world body said Pakistan would remain suspended until the PFF congress made those amendments. Pakistan football has been run by a FIFA appointed Normalisation Committee since June 2019 which was tasked with holding elections and cleaning up parallel groupings in the football set-up but it has failed to execute these plans properly.
    
                The Normalisation Committee heads and members have changed in the last five but the core issues in the sport in Pakistan still remain.
                
                The Normalisation Committee has been at loggerheads with the state-run Pakistan Sports Board which has caused a hold up in the amendments.
                
                Earlier this week, the PFF Normalisation Committee chairman Haroon Malik had warned a parliamentary panel that February 15 will be the last day of his tenure and Pakistan risked suspension if it didn't implement the constitutional amendments.
                
                Malik also made it clear that making the amendments didn't mean that he will become a potential candidate in the elections of the country's football governing body.
                
                Malik said the PFF Congress was not willing to make the amendments as directed by FIFA leading to a stand-off.
