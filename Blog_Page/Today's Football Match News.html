            <p class="tdnp">Lots of people are sleeping on just how progressive Crystal Palace have been under Oliver Glasner. If they pick up maximum points here, it would be their best points total after 25 games in Premier League history.

                It is about time they recorded some consistent wins over Everton - their head-to-head record against them is horrendous. Palace have won just once in the last 20 Premier League meetings going back to 2015.
                
                This looks an open goal for them if they turn up based on who Everton have missing in forward areas, with Abdoulaye Doucoure, Iliman Ndiaye, Dwight McNeil, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Orel Mangala all unavailable for this trip to south London - all five would start this game in an ideal world.</p>

            <h2 class="tdnh">The Fix To VAR? Semi-Automated Offside Technology To Make Its Debut In English Football</h2>
            <img style="width: 500px; padding-left: 500px;" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-08/ovbvd8qo_semiautomated-offside-technology-806_625x300_03_August_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605" alt="">
            <p class="tdnp">Semi-automated offside technology will make its debut in English football in seven of the eight FA Cup fifth-round ties, it was announced on Thursday. The technology will be used at all the ties hosted at Premier League stadiums, with the all-Championship clash between Preston v Burnley match the only exception. A statement issued on Thursday confirmed the Premier League would seek to introduce the technology in its competition later in the season. The Premier League hopes the SAOT technology will reduce the length of offside checks by an average of 31 seconds.

                It has worked with technology provider Genius Sports on the new offside system.
                
                Speaking last week, Premier League chief football officer Tony Scholes said there had been "significant progress" on the technology in recent weeks.
                
                "The system that we've adopted, we believe it to be the best system," he said.
                
                "We believe it to be the most accurate and the most future-proof system as well."
                
                European football's governing body UEFA introduced the technology in the Champions League at the start of the 2022/2023 campaign.
                
                FA Cup fifth-round ties will be held around the weekend of March 1 and 2.</p>
