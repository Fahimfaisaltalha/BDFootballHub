            <h1 class="tdnh">Cristiano Ronaldo Reaches Deal With Saudi Club Al Nassr To Extend Contract</h1>
            <img style="padding-left: 500px;" width="500px" src="../images/al naser cr7.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="tdnp">Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo has reached an agreement with Al Nassr to extend his contract by another year until June 2026, an official with the Saudi club told AFP on Monday. The official said the sides have agreed on the renewable extension of Ronaldo's contract, "but it has not been signed yet. An announcement will be made over the coming days". Ronaldo turned 40 last week with his current contract due to end in June 2025. The former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus star joined Al Nassr in January 2023 and has since scored 82 goals in 90 matches. 

                In August, Ronaldo said he would stay with Al Nassr through the end of his professional career, which may be "soon or in two or three years".
                
                "But it'll most likely happen with Al Nassr, in the team that makes me happy... and where I feel good."
                
                The Portuguese great appeared to trade an end-of-career payday for football obscurity when he moved to Riyadh's Al Nassr two years ago in a deal said to be worth $250 million.
                
                But his influence became clear when he was followed by a parade of ageing superstars to the big-spending Saudi Pro League.
                
                Saudi Arabia was then awarded the 2034 World Cup in December, the crowning glory for the oil-rich kingdom's strategy of revamping its image through sports, tourism and culture.
                
                When Ronaldo launched his YouTube channel in August, he gained one million subscribers in just 90 minutes and 20 million within 24 hours. He currently has 73.5 million.
                
                Although World Cup glory has probably eluded him, unlike his Argentine rival Lionel Messi, records still dangle in front of the five-time Ballon d'Or and Champions League winner.

                Despite his prodigious form as he closes in on 1,000 professional goals in official matches, Ronaldo is yet to win a Saudi or continental trophy with Al Nassr, with the Arab Club Champions Cup of 2023 his only triumph with the club.</p>

            <h2 class="tdnh">Liverpool Held By Everton, Four Red Cards In Fiery Last Goodison Park Derby</h2>
            <img style="width: 500px; padding-left: 500px;" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-02/u7ko3dgo_liverpool-afp_625x300_13_February_25.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605" alt="">
            <p class="tdnp">James Tarkowski struck in the 98th minute to salvage a 2-2 draw for Everton against Liverpool as four red cards were issued after full-time on a dramatic final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Wednesday. Liverpool edge seven points clear at the top of the Premier League but were denied a vital win by Tarkowski's blistering strike after Mohamed Salah put Arne Slot's men in front. Everton's Abdoulaye Doucoure, Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones, Slot and his assistant Sipke Hulshoff were then sent off as tempers flared at the final whistle on a night Liverpool will come to regret if they do not go on to lift a record-equalling 20th English top flight title.

                "Very tough," said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. "We saw the celebrations they had in the end so we know how much it meant for them but the fact is it was disappointing for us."
                
                Everton are set to move to a new 53,000 capacity stadium in Liverpool's Bramley Moore Dock next season and gave their home since 1892 a night to remember against their local rivals.
                
                "Mental probably sums it up," said Everton boss David Moyes. "A brilliant finish for us, to finish the last Goodison Merseyside derby and score in the last minute is in a way fitting."
                
                Liverpool's quest for a quadruple came unstuck with a shock FA Cup exit to second-tier strugglers Plymouth on Sunday.
                
                Slot made 10 changes as he resorted to his strongest available side with Salah and Van Dijk among those who had been afforded the weekend off.
                
                Everton's own FA Cup exit to Bournemouth on Saturday had punctured some of their momentum since Moyes' return for a second spell in charge.
                
                The Toffees had won their previous three Premier League games to pull nine points clear of the relegation zone and got off to a flying start.
                
                Liverpool were caught napping on 11 minutes by a quick free-kick by Jarrad Branthwaite to free Beto, who beat Alisson Becker for his third goal in two league games.
                
                The visitors could have been swept away in the feverish atmosphere early on but the Reds immediate response was the making of champions.
                
                Alexis Mac Allister started and finished the move as the diminutive Argentine midfielder ghosted into the penalty area to head in Salah's teasing cross.</p>
