            <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo, 'greatest scorer in history', turns 40</h3>
            <p>Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo is celebrating his 40th birthday today, boldly declaring himself "the greatest scorer" in football history in a recent interview.

                During a recent interview with Spanish television channel La Sexta, the Al Nassr striker confidently claimed the title of the best footballer in history, Sportstar reported.
                
                The five Ballon d'Or award winner described himself as the "most complete player who has ever existed," highlighting his unparalleled scoring abilities.
                
                "I'm the best player in football history. I haven't seen anyone better than me in football history, and I'm saying truth from my heart," he said.
                
                "I am the greatest scorer in history. Although I am not left-footed, I am in the top 10 in history for goals scored with the left foot. These are numbers."
                
                The former Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus star holds numerous records in men's international football, including the most appearances at 217 and the highest number of goals scored at 135.
                
                Additionally, Ronaldo also discussed his long-debated rivalry with Argentine football legend Lionel Messi, calling it a "healthy fight".
                
                "I've never had a bad relationship with Messi. We've shared 15 years of awards, and we've always gotten along well. I remember that I used to translate English for him, and it was very funny," he said
                
                "He defended his club and I mine, and his national team and I mine. I think we gave each other feedback. There were years when he wanted to play everything, and so did I. It was a healthy fight."</p>
