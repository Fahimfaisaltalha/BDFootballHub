            <img style="padding-left: 500px;" width="500px" src="../images/al naser cr7.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="tdnp">Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo has reached an agreement with Al Nassr to extend his contract by another year until June 2026, an official with the Saudi club told AFP on Monday. The official said the sides have agreed on the renewable extension of Ronaldo's contract, "but it has not been signed yet. An announcement will be made over the coming days". Ronaldo turned 40 last week with his current contract due to end in June 2025. The former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus star joined Al Nassr in January 2023 and has since scored 82 goals in 90 matches. 

                In August, Ronaldo said he would stay with Al Nassr through the end of his professional career, which may be "soon or in two or three years".
                
                "But it'll most likely happen with Al Nassr, in the team that makes me happy... and where I feel good."
                
                The Portuguese great appeared to trade an end-of-career payday for football obscurity when he moved to Riyadh's Al Nassr two years ago in a deal said to be worth $250 million.
                
                But his influence became clear when he was followed by a parade of ageing superstars to the big-spending Saudi Pro League.
                
                Saudi Arabia was then awarded the 2034 World Cup in December, the crowning glory for the oil-rich kingdom's strategy of revamping its image through sports, tourism and culture.
                
                When Ronaldo launched his YouTube channel in August, he gained one million subscribers in just 90 minutes and 20 million within 24 hours. He currently has 73.5 million.
                
                Although World Cup glory has probably eluded him, unlike his Argentine rival Lionel Messi, records still dangle in front of the five-time Ballon d'Or and Champions League winner.

                Despite his prodigious form as he closes in on 1,000 professional goals in official matches, Ronaldo is yet to win a Saudi or continental trophy with Al Nassr, with the Arab Club Champions Cup of 2023 his only triumph with the club.</p>

            <h2 class="tdnh">The Fix To VAR? Semi-Automated Offside Technology To Make Its Debut In English Football</h2>
            <img style="width: 500px; padding-left: 500px;" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-08/ovbvd8qo_semiautomated-offside-technology-806_625x300_03_August_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605" alt="">
            <p class="tdnp">Semi-automated offside technology will make its debut in English football in seven of the eight FA Cup fifth-round ties, it was announced on Thursday. The technology will be used at all the ties hosted at Premier League stadiums, with the all-Championship clash between Preston v Burnley match the only exception. A statement issued on Thursday confirmed the Premier League would seek to introduce the technology in its competition later in the season. The Premier League hopes the SAOT technology will reduce the length of offside checks by an average of 31 seconds.

                It has worked with technology provider Genius Sports on the new offside system.
                
                Speaking last week, Premier League chief football officer Tony Scholes said there had been "significant progress" on the technology in recent weeks.
                
                "The system that we've adopted, we believe it to be the best system," he said.
                
                "We believe it to be the most accurate and the most future-proof system as well."
                
                European football's governing body UEFA introduced the technology in the Champions League at the start of the 2022/2023 campaign.

                FA Cup fifth-round ties will be held around the weekend of March 1 and 2.</p>
