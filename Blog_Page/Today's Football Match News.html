            <h1 class="tdnh">Cristiano Ronaldo Reaches Deal With Saudi Club Al Nassr To Extend Contract</h1>
            <img style="padding-left: 500px;" width="500px" src="../images/al naser cr7.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="tdnp">Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo has reached an agreement with Al Nassr to extend his contract by another year until June 2026, an official with the Saudi club told AFP on Monday. The official said the sides have agreed on the renewable extension of Ronaldo's contract, "but it has not been signed yet. An announcement will be made over the coming days". Ronaldo turned 40 last week with his current contract due to end in June 2025. The former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus star joined Al Nassr in January 2023 and has since scored 82 goals in 90 matches. 

                In August, Ronaldo said he would stay with Al Nassr through the end of his professional career, which may be "soon or in two or three years".
                
                "But it'll most likely happen with Al Nassr, in the team that makes me happy... and where I feel good."
                
                The Portuguese great appeared to trade an end-of-career payday for football obscurity when he moved to Riyadh's Al Nassr two years ago in a deal said to be worth $250 million.
                
                But his influence became clear when he was followed by a parade of ageing superstars to the big-spending Saudi Pro League.
                
                Saudi Arabia was then awarded the 2034 World Cup in December, the crowning glory for the oil-rich kingdom's strategy of revamping its image through sports, tourism and culture.
                
                When Ronaldo launched his YouTube channel in August, he gained one million subscribers in just 90 minutes and 20 million within 24 hours. He currently has 73.5 million.
                
                Although World Cup glory has probably eluded him, unlike his Argentine rival Lionel Messi, records still dangle in front of the five-time Ballon d'Or and Champions League winner.

                Despite his prodigious form as he closes in on 1,000 professional goals in official matches, Ronaldo is yet to win a Saudi or continental trophy with Al Nassr, with the Arab Club Champions Cup of 2023 his only triumph with the club.</p>

            <h2 class="tdnh">FIFA Suspends Pakistan Football Federation</h2>
            <img style="width: 500px; padding-left: 500px;" src="https://i.dawn.com/primary/2024/06/1115035920b50cc.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="tdnp">The International Football Federation (FIFA) has suspended the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) after it failed to make amendments to its constitution which the world body deemed necessary for smooth and just governance of the sport in the country. The world body said Pakistan would remain suspended until the PFF congress made those amendments. Pakistan football has been run by a FIFA appointed Normalisation Committee since June 2019 which was tasked with holding elections and cleaning up parallel groupings in the football set-up but it has failed to execute these plans properly.
    
                The Normalisation Committee heads and members have changed in the last five but the core issues in the sport in Pakistan still remain.
                
                The Normalisation Committee has been at loggerheads with the state-run Pakistan Sports Board which has caused a hold up in the amendments.
                
                Earlier this week, the PFF Normalisation Committee chairman Haroon Malik had warned a parliamentary panel that February 15 will be the last day of his tenure and Pakistan risked suspension if it didn't implement the constitutional amendments.
                
                Malik also made it clear that making the amendments didn't mean that he will become a potential candidate in the elections of the country's football governing body.
                
                Malik said the PFF Congress was not willing to make the amendments as directed by FIFA leading to a stand-off.

                This is Pakistan Football Federation's third suspension since 2017.</p>
