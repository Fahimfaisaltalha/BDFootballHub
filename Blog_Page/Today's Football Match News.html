            <h1 class="tdnh">Liverpool Draw PSG, Madrid Clubs Clash In Champions League Last 16</h1>
            <img style="padding-left: 500px;" width="500px" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-02/lg61kmfg_team-liverpool-afp_625x300_07_February_25.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605" alt="">
            <p class="tdnp">Liverpool will take on Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of this season's Champions League while Friday's draw also threw up a showdown between reigning champions Real Madrid and their city rivals Atletico. Arne Slot's Liverpool finished first in the 36-team league phase of the competition to qualify directly for this stage, while PSG finished 15th and had to come through a two-legged play-off tie in which they crushed fellow French side Brest 10-0 on aggregate. The first leg will take place at the Parc des Princes in Paris on March 4 or 5, with the return at Anfield a week later.

                The clubs last met in the Champions League in the group stage in 2018/19, when PSG won 2-1 at home after Liverpool triumphed 3-2 in England.
                
                The only previous knockout tie between the sides came in the semi-finals of the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup in 1997, when PSG won 3-2 on aggregate before losing the final to Barcelona.
                
                Liverpool are currently eight points clear of Arsenal at the top of the English Premier League having played a game more than their closest rivals, while Luis Enrique's PSG are unbeaten in Ligue 1 this season and sit 10 points clear at the summit.
                
                With the draw being made up to and including the semi-finals, PSG and Liverpool know the winner of their tie will face either Club Brugge or Aston Villa in the last eight.
                
                That raises the possibility of an all-English quarter-final between the teams who succeeded each other as European Cup winners in the early 1980s.
                
                Villa will face Club Brugge seeking revenge for their 1-0 defeat against the same opponents in Belgium in the league phase in November.
                
                Real, fresh from eliminating Manchester City in the play-offs, will be at home in the first leg against Atletico.
                
                The rivals from the Spanish capital met in the competition in four straight seasons in the last decade, with Real coming out on top every time.
                
                They won the finals of 2014 and 2016, as well as in the quarter-finals in 2015 and in the semi-finals in 2017.
                
                "It's an amazing tie, and we are ready for it," insisted Atletico coach Diego Simeone, who was in charge for all of the past Champions League meetings between the sides.

            <h2 class="tdnh">Manchester United To Face Real Sociedad In Europa League Last 16, Rangers Play Fenerbahce</h2>
            <img style="width: 500px; padding-left: 500px;" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-02/m77sp3u8_manchester-united_625x300_08_February_25.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605" alt="">
            <p class="tdnp">Manchester United were drawn Friday to play Real Sociedad of Spain in the last 16 of this season's Europa League, while Rangers will take on Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce, and Tottenham Hotspur face AZ Alkmaar. Ruben Amorim's United are struggling in the Premier League this season but finished third in the league phase of the Europa League. They will travel to San Sebastian for the first leg on March 6 before the return a week later against a Real Sociedad side who reached this stage after beating Midtjylland of Denmark in the play-off round. The clubs have met several times in European competition in recent years, with United winning a Europa League knockout phase play-off tie in 2021 before both sides each won away from home in the group stage in 2022/23. They also faced off in the Champions League group stage in 2013.

                Whoever wins will advance to a last-eight tie against either Lyon or FCSB. The Romanians lost 2-0 at home to United in their last game in the group phase last month.
                
                Fenerbahce will welcome beaten 2022 finalists Rangers to Istanbul for the first leg of their tie in a competition coach Mourinho won with United in 2017. He also won its predecessor, the UEFA Cup, as Porto boss in 2003.
                
                If Fenerbahce win, Mourinho could come up in the quarter-finals against one of his old clubs in Roma, with whom he won the Europa Conference League in 2022.
                
                However, Claudio Ranieri's Roma face a tough task in the last 16 against Athletic Bilbao, who are determined to go all the way to this season's final, which will be played at their San Mames home on May 21.
                
                Spurs will go to the Netherlands for the first leg of their last-16 tie against AZ, who they defeated 1-0 in the league phase in October.
                
                If they win, Ange Postecoglou's team could be back in the Netherlands in the quarter-finals, with the victors in that tie playing either Ajax or 2022 tournament winners Eintracht Frankfurt.
                
                Spurs and Manchester United cannot meet until the final, but the Old Trafford club could face either Mourinho's Fenerbahce or Rangers in the last four.

                Last season's Conference League winners Olympiakos of Greece will play Norwegian champions Bodo/Glimt in the last 16, for the right to take on either Lazio -- who finished first in the league phase -- or Viktoria Plzen of the Czech Republic in the quarters.</p>
