            <h1 class="tdnh">Guardiola underestimating Man City chances, says Real Madrid's Ancelotti</h1>
            <img style="padding-left: 500px;" width="500px" src="https://cdn.resfu.com/scripts/tmp_images/afp_en_36f54edc0d25d9c5500e7440ca4a8e7f970babcf.jpg?size=1000x&lossy=1" alt="">
            <p class="tdnp">European champions Madrid hold a 3-2 lead on City, who have struggled this season and are fourth in the Premier League, ahead of the play-off round second leg on Wednesday at the Santiago Bernabeu.

                After thrashing Newcastle 4-0 on Saturday, Guardiola said English champions City have only a one per cent chance of ousting the record 15-time European Cup winners.
                
                "He does not truly think that tomorrow I'll ask him before the game - do you really think you've got a one per cent chance?" Ancelotti told a news conference. "He really thinks they've got more chance than that... we don't think we have 99 per cent chance.
                
                "We think we have a small advantage that we have to take advantage of and try to play the same game we set up in the first leg, which went well."
                
                Ancelotti confirmed defender Antonio Rudiger was fit to start for the holders after injury but Lucas Vazquez would only be ready for the bench. The coach reiterated his frustration with Spanish refereeing, following some controversial decisions which went against his side in recent La Liga matches.
                
                Ancelotti said he was more comfortable with refereeing in the Champions League. "Statistics speak for themselves, in Europe, there's less controversy in this sense, and there are fewer VAR interventions," said Ancelotti. "The VAR only intervenes when it's necessary, and usually the Champions League features the best referees from each country, so the quality is very high in this sense."
                
                England international Jude Bellingham was sent off for dissent during Madrid's 1-1 draw at Osasuna on Saturday in La Liga. Bellingham's teammate Federico Valverde said he did not want the midfielder to change his ways.
                
                "What I want is players who leave their soul out on the pitch, in this case with Jude in the last game, I always want him to be like that," Valverde told reporters. "Jude is a player who shows character, who always wants to win, who always wants to fight. This time he got a red card, but I like that he's giving everything, his spikiness... we have to stay united as a team."

            <h2 class="tdnh">Liverpool can handle title tension: Slot</h2>
            <img style="width: 500px; padding-left: 500px;" src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/02/Neymar-Santos-2025-02-7d410fbe02ba3c3172c6cfab077a7200-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=640&height=360" alt="">
            <p class="tdnp">Slot's side head to Aston Villa on Wednesday knowing a victory would move them 10 points clear of second-placed Arsenal in their bid to clinch a record-equalling 20th English title. But Liverpool, in dynamic form for much of the season, have looked less secure of late and almost blew a two-goal lead in Sunday's 2-1 win over lowly Wolves at Anfield.

                The Reds had already suffered a costly collapse in the Merseyside derby draw just days earlier when Everton's James Tarkowski scored a stoppage-time equaliser.
                
                Liverpool's reserves also crashed out of the FA Cup with an embarrassing fourth-round loss at second-tier Plymouth recently, leading to fears the treble chasers are beginning to crack as expectations increase.
                
                Reds left-back Andrew Robertson admitted after the Wolves game that it was natural for the players to be nervous as they get closer to the finish line. But Slot pointed to Liverpool's ability to grind out several wins by a one-goal margin already this season as proof they won't crumble under pressure.
                
                "It is because we are going to the end of the season, not because of us but what people make of it," Slot told reporters on Tuesday. "We have won other games at home or away by one goal when it was also tight. I remember Crystal Palace away when it was tight in the end.
                
                "If this happens at the end of the season you guys are going to talk about nerves. To secure a win in the Premier League, if we are winning 1-0, is going to be a lot of defending and hard work."</p>
