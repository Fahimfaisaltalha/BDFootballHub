            <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo, 'greatest scorer in history', turns 40</h3>
            <p>Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo is celebrating his 40th birthday today, boldly declaring himself "the greatest scorer" in football history in a recent interview.

                During a recent interview with Spanish television channel La Sexta, the Al Nassr striker confidently claimed the title of the best footballer in history, Sportstar reported.
                
                The five Ballon d'Or award winner described himself as the "most complete player who has ever existed," highlighting his unparalleled scoring abilities.
                
                "I'm the best player in football history. I haven't seen anyone better than me in football history, and I'm saying truth from my heart," he said.
                
                "I am the greatest scorer in history. Although I am not left-footed, I am in the top 10 in history for goals scored with the left foot. These are numbers."
                
                The former Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus star holds numerous records in men's international football, including the most appearances at 217 and the highest number of goals scored at 135.
                
                Additionally, Ronaldo also discussed his long-debated rivalry with Argentine football legend Lionel Messi, calling it a "healthy fight".
                
                "I've never had a bad relationship with Messi. We've shared 15 years of awards, and we've always gotten along well. I remember that I used to translate English for him, and it was very funny," he said
                
                "He defended his club and I mine, and his national team and I mine. I think we gave each other feedback. There were years when he wanted to play everything, and so did I. It was a healthy fight."</p>

            <p>Rodrygo seems to be absolutely delighted to see Neymar Jr back at Santos after joining them as a free agent.

                The Brazilian winger played a key role in Real Madrid’s 3-2 win over Leganes, providing the assist for Luka Modric’s opener.
                
                But soon after the game, Rodrygo hurried back to be able to watch Neymar’s return for Santos in their game against Botafogo.</p>

        <h3>FIFA Suspends Pakistan Football Federation</h3>
        <p>The International Football Federation (FIFA) has suspended the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) after it failed to make amendments to its constitution which the world body deemed necessary for smooth and just governance of the sport in the country. The world body said Pakistan would remain suspended until the PFF congress made those amendments. Pakistan football has been run by a FIFA appointed Normalisation Committee since June 2019 which was tasked with holding elections and cleaning up parallel groupings in the football set-up but it has failed to execute these plans properly.

            The Normalisation Committee heads and members have changed in the last five but the core issues in the sport in Pakistan still remain.
            
            The Normalisation Committee has been at loggerheads with the state-run Pakistan Sports Board which has caused a hold up in the amendments.
            
            Earlier this week, the PFF Normalisation Committee chairman Haroon Malik had warned a parliamentary panel that February 15 will be the last day of his tenure and Pakistan risked suspension if it didn't implement the constitutional amendments.
            
            Malik also made it clear that making the amendments didn't mean that he will become a potential candidate in the elections of the country's football governing body.
            
            Malik said the PFF Congress was not willing to make the amendments as directed by FIFA leading to a stand-off.
